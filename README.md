## About project
In this challenge, you'll be building out an FAQ accordion. This is an extremely common front-end pattern, so it's a great opportunity to get some practice in! The challenge is to build out this FAQ accordion card and get it looking as close to the design as possible. You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Users should be able to:
1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size. 2. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
3. Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked.
4. Bonus: Complete the challenge without using JavaScript.
